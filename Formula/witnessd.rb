    <<~EOS
      witnessd has been rewritten in Rust for improved performance and security.

      To get started:

        1. Initialize witnessd:
           witnessd init

        2. Create your first checkpoint:
           witnessd commit your-document.md -m "Initial draft"

      For the legacy Go implementation, see:
        https://github.com/writerslogic/witnessd/tree/legacy-go-v1

      Privacy note: Keystroke tracking counts keystrokes only.
      It does NOT capture which keys are pressed.
